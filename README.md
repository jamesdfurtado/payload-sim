## Overview

I designed this project with strong object-oriented, systems engineering, and testing principles to demonstrate both my technical capabilities and genuine interest in defense industry development practices.


This simulator recreates the complex environment of a submarine's payload launch system, including power management, depth control, sonar operations, target acquisition, and launch sequence handling with emphasis on safety protocols and operational correctness.
