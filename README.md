## Overview

This simulator recreates the complex environment of a submarine's payload launch system, including power management, depth control, sonar operations, target acquisition, and launch sequence handling. 

I designed this project with strong object-oriented, systems engineering, and testing principles to simulate how a real defense contracting company may develop a project like this.
